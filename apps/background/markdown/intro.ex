  Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable
  applications.

  Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant
  systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

  To learn more about Elixir, check our getting started guide. Or keep reading to get an overview
  of the platform, language and tools.

  ## Key Features:

  Scalability, Fault-tolerance

  ## Examples:
